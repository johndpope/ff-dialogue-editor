# Final Frontier Dialogue Editor
A complete set of tools to create dynamic dialogue trees for video games.

## Branches
The `main` branch contains the most up-to-date code, and is therefore not considered stable for release. However, the `release` branch will always contain the most recent stable release.

Any other branches are used for testing purposes and should never be cloned or downloaded to build a version for regular use.
