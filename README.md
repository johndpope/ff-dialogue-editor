# Final Frontier Dialogue Editor
A complete set of tools to create dynamic dialogue trees for video games.

Created using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [JoinJS](http://www.jointjs.com/) and [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron).

## Branches
The `main` branch contains the most up-to-date code, and is therefore not considered stable for release. However, the `release` branch will always contain the most recent stable release.

Any other branches are used for testing purposes and should never be cloned or downloaded to build a version for regular use.

## Install
Run `npm install` to get all dependencies, then `npm start` to run electron.
